# Clocker

## Context

Project created during a free event week by [Codar.me](https://codar.me/).

> The videos were temporary and were removed from YouTube, so I can't link to them.

## Scope

The project enable users to sign up and sign in.

Once they're signed in, they can book time slots in agendas of other users as well as have their own agenda.

Each user is able to see their own agenda with the details of each person who booked a time slot.

## Stack

- Next.js for SSR and serverless API routes
- Chakra UI for building the pages and components
- Firebase for Authentication and Database (Firestore)
- Formik + Yup for form validation
